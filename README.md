# dictator

### Description
This python file takes your name and age as input and tells you whether you're young or old according to a very precise mathematical formula contrived by Harvard graduates.

#### Group Members
Jeffrey Huang (PM) and Gabriel Hanley 

### Installation instructions:
This program is intended for use exclusively through JupyterHub. It can be downloaded/forked through GitHub as with any project (if you're somehow reading this without the link, here it is: "https://github.com/jhuang0420/dictator.git"), and main.py can be opened in JupyterHub. Congratulations! This concludes the bulk of the project with which a user will interact.

### Usage instructions:
When the project is opened as detailed above, running main.py will prompt you for an input. Enter this as appropriate, and the python file will magically interpret this input and tell you a deep, secret truth about yourself.

### How To Contribute:
1. Fork the project from GitHub.
2. Create your own branch via your own alterations and improvements!
3. Commit your changes with a helpful message so we know what you did.
4. Push your changed branch back to main, and make a pull request. We'll get back to you!
